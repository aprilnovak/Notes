\section{The Physics of Turbulence}

In the study of turbulence, many mathematical models separate the turbulent field into the sum of the mean field and a fluctuation, where a mean is denoted with angled brackets \(\la(.)\ra\) and the fluctuation with a prime. For instance, the velocity is decomposed into:

\beq
\vv{V}(\vv{x},t)=\la\vv{V}(x,t)\rangle+\vv{V}(x,t)'
\eeq

This decomposition is sometimes referred to as a ``Reynolds decomposition.'' Likewise, density and energy can also be decomposed. 

\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
Some important statistical results are needed before carrying out the derivation of the averaged Navier Stokes equations. The results presented here will be often in the derivation of turbulence models. A mean is defined as:

\beq
\la U\ra\equiv\int_{0}^{\infty}Vf(V)dV
\eeq

The mean of the mean is simply equal to the mean, since the integral of \(f(V)\) from 0 to \(\infty\) is by definition unity. The mean of the fluctuation is zero:

\beqa
\la U'\ra\equiv&\int_{0}^{\infty}(V-\la V\ra)f(V)dV\\
\equiv& \int_{0}^{\infty}Vf(V)dV - \int_{0}^{\infty}\la V\ra f(V)dV\\
\equiv&\la U\ra - \la U\ra\\
\equiv&\ 0\\
\eeqa

The mean of the product of a fluctuation and a mean is:

\beqa
\la U'\la\rho\ra\ra\equiv&\int_{0}^{\infty}(V-\la V\ra)\la p\ra f(V)dV\\
\equiv&\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(V\la p\ra-\la V\ra\la p\ra\right)f(V)dV\\
\equiv&\la V\ra\la\rho\ra-\la V\ra\la\rho\ra\\
\equiv&\ 0\\
\eeqa

\end{tcolorbox}




\subsection{The Mean Flow Equations}

The mean flow equations are derived by substituting these decompositions into the Navier-Stokes equations and then taking the mean of the entire equation. The continuity equation becomes:

\beqa
\frac{\partial \left(\la\rho\ra+\rho'\right)}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot \left((\la\rho\ra+\rho')(\la\vv{V}\ra+\vv{V}')\right)=&0\\
\frac{\partial\la\rho\ra}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial\rho'}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot \left(\la\rho\ra\la\vv{V}\ra+\la\rho\ra\vv{V}'+\la\vv{V}\ra\rho'+\rho'\vv{V}'\right)=&0\\
\eeqa

Taking the mean of the equation, and recognizing that taking the mean and differentiation with respect to both time and space commute:

\beqa
\frac{\partial\la\la\rho\ra\ra}{\partial t}+\cancel{\frac{\partial\la\rho'\ra}{\partial t}}+\nabla\cdot\left(\la\la\rho\ra\la\vv{V}\ra\ra+\la\la\rho\ra\vv{V}'\ra+\la\la\vv{V}\ra\rho'\ra+\la\rho'\vv{V}'\ra\right)=&0\\
\frac{\partial\la\rho\ra}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot\left(\la\rho\ra\la\vv{V}\ra+\cancel{\la\la\rho\ra\vv{V}'\ra}+\cancel{\la\la\vv{V}\ra\rho'\ra}+\la\rho'\vv{V}'\ra\right)=&0\\
\frac{\partial\la\rho\ra}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot\left(\la\rho\ra\la\vv{V}\ra+\la\rho'\vv{V}'\ra\right)=&0\\
\eeqa

For incompressible flow, the continuity equation simplifies to:

\beq
\label{eq:1}
\nabla\cdot\vv{V}=0
\eeq

Taking the average of this equation:

\beq
\label{eq:2}
\nabla\cdot\la\vv{V}\ra=0
\eeq

Alternatively, plugging in the Reynolds decomposition to Eq. \eqref{eq:1} gives:

\beq
\label{eq:3}
\nabla\cdot\la\vv{V}\ra+\nabla\cdot\vv{V}'=0
\eeq

Subtracting Eq. \eqref{eq:2} from Eq. \eqref{eq:3} shows that, for incompressible flow, both the mean of the velocity and the fluctuation in velocity are divergence-free. The derivation for the momentum equation is more complicated. For simplicity, the incompressible momentum equation will be the basis of investigation of turbulence. Due to the incompressibility assumption, the gravitational body force can be bundled into a reduced pressure \(P'=P+\rho gz\). Inserting the same Reynolds-decomposed quantities gives:

\beqa
\frac{\partial \vv{V}}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}(V_iV_j)+\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i}-\nu\frac{\partial^2 V_i}{\partial x_j\partial x_j}=&0\\
\frac{\partial (\la V_i\ra+V_i')}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left((\la V_j\ra+V_j')(\la V_i\ra+V_i')\right)+\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i}-\nu\frac{\partial^2 (\la V_i\ra+V_i')}{\partial x_j\partial x_j}=&0\\
\frac{\partial \la V_i\ra}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial V_i'}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left(\la V_i\ra\la V_j\ra+\la V_i\ra V_j'+\la V_j\ra V_i'+V_i'V_j'\right)+\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i}-\nu\left(\frac{\partial^2 \la V_i\ra}{\partial x_j\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial^2 V_i'}{\partial x_j\partial x_j}\right)=&0\\
\eeqa

Then, taking the mean of this equation, and recognizing that differentiation and taking the mean commute, where the decomposed pressure has also now been added and the density does not need to be decomposed because it has been assumed constant, the momentum equation becomes:

\beqa
\label{eq:AveNS}
\frac{\partial \la V_i\ra}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left(\la V_i\ra\la V_j\ra+\la V_i'V_j'\ra\right)+\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial \la P\ra}{\partial x_i}-\nu\frac{\partial^2 \la V_i\ra}{\partial x_j\partial x_j}=&0\\
\eeqa

The averaged Navier-Stokes equations are identical to the Navier-Stokes equations, except that they describe averaged velocities and pressure, and include the Reynolds stress term \(\partial\la V_i'V_j'\ra/\partial x_i\). These evolution equations are not the end of the study of turbulence however, because closure relationships are needed to describe the Reynolds stresses in terms of other solution variables or known quantities. 

These equations can also be derived in cylindrical coordinates for incompressible flow. The continuity equation becomes:

\beqa
\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial(rV_r)}{\partial r}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial V_{\theta}}{\partial\theta}+\frac{\partial V_z}{\partial z}=&0\\
\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial(r\la\la V_r\ra+V_r'\ra)}{\partial r}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial \la\la V_{\theta}\ra+V_{\theta}'\ra}{\partial\theta}+\frac{\partial \la\la V_z\ra+V_z'\ra}{\partial z}=&0\\
\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial(r\la V_r\ra)}{\partial r}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial \la V_{\theta}\ra}{\partial\theta}+\frac{\partial \la V_z\ra}{\partial z}=&0\\
\eeqa

where again, it is true that both \(\nabla\cdot\la \vv{V}\ra=0\) and \(\nabla\cdot\vv{V}'=0\). The three momentum equations are:

\beqa
\frac{\partial V_z}{\partial t}+V_z\frac{\partial V_z}{\partial z}+V_r\frac{\partial V_z}{\partial r}+\frac{V_{\theta}}{r}\frac{\partial V_z}{\partial\theta}=\frac{-1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial z}+\nu\nabla^2\la V_z\ra\\
\frac{\partial \la V_z\ra}{\partial t}+\la (\la V_z\ra + V_z')\frac{\partial (\la V_z\ra + V_z')}{\partial z}\ra+\la \la (V_r\ra+V_r')\frac{\partial (\la V_z\ra + V_z')}{\partial r}\ra+\la\frac{\la V_{\theta}\ra+V_{\theta}'}{r}\frac{\partial (\la V_z\ra + V_z')}{\partial\theta}\ra=\frac{-1}{\rho}\frac{\partial \la P\ra}{\partial z}\nu\nabla^2\la V_z\ra\\
\frac{\partial \la V_z\ra}{\partial t}+\la V_z\ra\frac{\partial \la V_z\ra}{\partial z}+\la V_z'\frac{\partial V_z'}{\partial z}\ra+\la V_r\ra\frac{\partial \la V_z\ra}{\partial r}+\la V_r'\frac{\partial V_z'}{\partial r}\ra+\frac{1}{r}\left(\la V_{\theta}\ra\frac{\partial\la V_z\ra}{\partial\theta}+\la V_{\theta}'\frac{\partial V_z'}{\partial \theta}\ra\right)=\frac{-1}{\rho}\frac{\partial \la P\ra}{\partial z}+\nu\nabla^2\la V_z\ra\\
\eeqa

For statistically axisymmetric flows, \(\la V_{\theta}\ra=\la V_r'V_{\theta}\ra=\la V_z'V_{\theta}'\ra=0\), and hence the above equations simplify to:

\beqa
\frac{\partial \la V_z\ra}{\partial t}+\la V_z\ra\frac{\partial \la V_z\ra}{\partial z}+\la V_r\ra\frac{\partial \la V_z\ra}{\partial r}=\frac{-1}{\rho}\frac{\partial \la P\ra}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial \la V_z'V_z'\ra}{\partial z}-\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial \la V_r'V_z'\ra}{\partial r}+\nu\nabla^2\la V_z\ra
\eeqa





\subsubsection{Mean Scalar Equation}
Mean equations can also be developed for a conserved passive scalar \(\phi\) that has no impact on the flow field but is transported by both advection and diffusion governed by:

\beq
\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\vv{V}\phi)=\Gamma\nabla^2\phi
\eeq

where \(\Gamma\) is the diffusivity. Inserting the Reynolds decomposition and taking the average of this governing equation gives:

\beqa
\frac{\partial\la\la\phi\ra+\phi'\ra}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot\la(\la\vv{V}\ra+\vv{V}')(\la\phi\ra+\phi')\ra=&\Gamma\nabla^2\la\la\phi\ra+\phi'\ra\\
\frac{\partial\la\phi\ra}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\la\vv{V}\ra\la\phi\ra+\la\vv{V}'\phi'\ra)=&\Gamma\nabla^2\la\phi\ra\\
\eeqa

\(\la\vv{V}'\phi'\ra\) represents the flux of \(\phi\) due to the fluctuating velocity field (the turbulent transport of \(\phi\)), and plays a similar role to the Reynolds stress term in the Reynolds equations. 







\subsubsection{Mean Pressure Poisson Equation}
For incompressible flow, pressure satisfies a Pressure-Poisson equation, the mean of which is:

\beqa
-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial^2 \la\la P\ra + P'\ra}{\partial x_i^2}=&\la\frac{\partial(\la V_i\ra+V_i')}{\partial x_j}\frac{\partial(\la V_j\ra+V_j')}{\partial x_i}\ra\\
-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial^2 \la P\ra}{\partial x_i^2}=&\la\frac{\partial\la V_i\ra}{\partial x_j}\frac{\partial\la V_j\ra}{\partial x_i}+\frac{\partial \la V_i\ra}{\partial x_j}\frac{\partial V_j'}{\partial x_i}+\frac{\partial \la V_j\ra}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial V_i'}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial V_j'}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial V_i'}{\partial x_j}\ra\\
-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial^2\la P\ra}{\partial x_i^2}=&\frac{\partial\la V_i\ra}{\partial x_j}\frac{\partial\la V_j\ra}{\partial x_i}+\frac{\partial \la V_j'V_i'\ra}{\partial x_i\partial x_j}\\
\eeqa

The mean rate of strain \(\la e_{ij}\ra\) and mean rate of rotation \(\la\xi_{ij}\ra\) are:

\beq
\la e_{ij}\ra=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial\la V_i\ra}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial\la V_j\ra}{\partial x_i}\right)
\eeq 

\beq
\la \xi_{ij}\ra=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial\la V_i\ra}{\partial x_j}-\frac{\partial\la V_j\ra}{\partial x_i}\right)
\eeq 

From the above, the Pressure-Poisson equation can equivalently be stated as:

% exercise 4.3
\beq
-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial^2\la P\ra}{\partial x_i^2}=\la e_{ij}\ra^2-\la \xi_{ij}\ra^2+\frac{\partial \la V_j'V_i'\ra}{\partial x_i\partial x_j}
\eeq




\subsubsection{Reynolds Stresses}

As can be seen from the form of the mean equations, the Reynolds stresses are essential for the development of turbulence - if the Reynolds stresses were zero, then the mean flow equations would be identical in form to the Navier-Stokes equations, and hence the mean velocity field would be identical to the actual velocity field, which is clearly not the case for turbulent flows. To show why the Reynolds stresses are indeed stresses, rewrite the average momentum equation as:

\beqa
\label{eq:RewrittenMom}
\frac{\partial \la V_i\ra}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial(\la V_i\ra\la V_j\ra)}{\partial x_j}=&-\frac{\partial\la V_i'V_j'\ra}{\partial x_j}-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial \la P\ra}{\partial x_i}+\nu\frac{\partial^2 \la V_i\ra}{\partial x_j\partial x_j}\\
\rho\frac{\partial \la V_i\ra}{\partial t}+\rho\frac{\partial(\la V_i\ra\la V_j\ra)}{\partial x_j}=&\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left\lbrack\mu\left(\frac{\partial\la V_i\ra}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial\la V_j\ra}{\partial x_i}\right)-\la P\ra\delta_{ij}-\rho\la V_i'V_j'\ra\right\rbrack\\
\eeqa

where the stresses have all been written in a form that is consistent with the form of the Cauchy identity, where the viscous stress term would implicitly be simpler since we have assumed incompressibility (but we leave it in this form to be explicit). The square brackets represent the sum of three stresses - the viscous stress, the isotropic stress from the mean pressure field, and the Reynolds stress that arises from the fluctuating velocity field. To obtain units of stress, \(\la V_i'V_j'\ra\) should be multiplied by density, though often either form is referred to as a stress. Viscous stress arises due to momentum transfer at the molecular level. Similarly, Reynolds stress arises from momentum transfer due to the fluctuating velocity field. For an arbitrary control volume, the momentum flux into that volume is:

\beq
\textrm{momentum flux}=-\int_{\partial\Omega}\rho\vv{V}\vv{V}\cdot\hat{n}dS
\eeq

where the integral is negative because the normal of the surface is defined to be pointing outwards. Applying the divergence rule and taking the mean:

\beq
\la\textrm{momentum flux}\ra_i=-\int_{\Omega}\rho\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left(\la V_i\ra\la V_j\ra+\la V_i'V_j'\ra\right)dV
\eeq

where the RHS can be seen to be identical to the flux of momentum into the control volume that also appears in Eq. \eqref{eq:AveNS}. So, the Reynolds stress in the Reynolds equations arises due to the mean momentum flux due to the fluctuating velocity on the boundary. So, the presence of turbulence increases the total momentum flux into a volume since the fluctuating velocity components contribute to this momentum flux - this is why turbulence produces very good mixing. 

The Reynolds stresses are components of a symmetric, second-order tensor. The diagonal components are normal stresses, while off-diagonal components are shear stresses. In the principal axes of the Reynolds stress tensor, the shear stresses are zero, while the normal stresses are non-negative eigenvalues. In extreme circumstances, one of these eigenvalues may be zero. The distinction between normal and shear stresses depends on the choice of coordinate system, but you can make a definitive statement about isotropic and anisotropic components of the Reynolds stress tensor. The isotropic stress component \(i_{ij}\) is equal to one third of the trace of the Reynolds stress tensor, since this represents isotropic expansion, where the factor of \(1/3\) cancels \(\delta_{ii}\): 

\beq
i_{ij} = \frac{1}{3}\la V_i'V_i'\ra\delta_{ij}
\eeq

The Reynolds stress tensor is the sum of the isotropic part \(i_{ij}\) and the anisotropic part \(a_{ij}\):

\beqa
a_{ij}=&\la V_i'V_j'\ra-\frac{1}{3}\la V_i'V_i'\ra\delta_{ij}\\
=& \la V_i'V_j'\ra-\frac{2}{3}k\delta_{ij}\\
\eeqa

where \(k\) is the turbulent kinetic energy defined in Eq. \eqref{eq:turbenergy}. Plugging in this expansion for \(\la V_i'V_j'\ra\) into Eq. \eqref{eq:RewrittenMom} shows that only the anisotropic component of the Reynolds stress is effective in transporting momentum, since the isotropic component could be absorbed into a modified pressure term:

\beqa
\rho\frac{\partial \la V_i\ra}{\partial t}+\rho\frac{\partial(\la V_i\ra\la V_j\ra)}{\partial x_j}=&\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left\lbrack\mu\left(\frac{\partial\la V_i\ra}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial\la V_j\ra}{\partial x_i}\right)-\la P\ra\delta_{ij}-\rho \left(a_{ij}+\frac{2}{3}k\delta_{ij}\right)\right\rbrack\\
=&\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left\lbrack\mu\left(\frac{\partial\la V_i\ra}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial\la V_j\ra}{\partial x_i}\right)-\left(\la P\ra+\frac{2}{3}k\right)\delta_{ij}-\rho a_{ij}\right\rbrack
\eeqa

This is very similar to the Navier-Stokes equations, where only the anisotropic component \(2\mu e_{ij}+\nabla\cdot\vv{V}\delta_{ij}\) contributes to the stress, and the isotropic component is bundled into the pressure term (because it is defined to be the pressure itself). 

The turbulent kinetic energy \(k\) is defined as the kinetic energy per unit mass associated with the fluctuating velocity field, and is equal to half the trace of the Reynolds stress tensor:

\beq
\label{eq:turbenergy}
k\equiv\frac{1}{2}\la V_iV_i\ra
\eeq






\subsubsubsection{Symmetries of the Reynolds Stress Tensor}
Often, the flow geometry can be used to conclude that certain components of the Reynolds stress are zero. When a flow is independent of the \(x_3\) coordinate, such as for axisymmetric flows that are independent of \(\theta\), statistics are therefore also independent of that coordinate. Hence, the derivative of the PDF of velocity \(f\) with respect to that coordinate will be zero:

\beq
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_3}=0
\eeq

and \(f\) will also be invariant with respect to reflections of that axis:

\beq
f(V_1,V_2,V_3; x_1,x_2,x_3,t)=f(V_1,V_2,-V_3;x_1,x_2,-x_3,t)
\eeq

For the above equation, when \(x_3=0\), you can conclude that \(\la V_3\ra=-\la V_3\ra=0\). By similar logic, \(\la V_1V_3\ra=\la V_2V_3\ra=0\) (though \(\la V_3V_3\ra\neq0\) because the negative sign will cancel). Then, due to the fact that the flow is statistically invariant with respect to \(x_3\), these conditions apply not just at \(x_3=0\), but throughout the entire flow field. So, for statistically two-dimensional flows such as this, where the flow is statistically invariant with respect to the \(x_3\) axis, the Reynolds stress tensor simplifies to:

\beq
\la V_iV_j\ra=\begin{bmatrix}\la V_1^2\ra&\la V_1V_2\ra&0\\
\la V_1V_2\ra & \la V_2^2\ra & 0\\
0 & 0 & \la V_3^2\ra\end{bmatrix}
\eeq

A flow can be both independent of one coordinate, and also symmetric about other coordinates. For instance, for flow in a pipe, the flow is symmetric in the \(x_2\) coordinate (\(r\) coordinate). This implies that \(f\) is also symmetric with respect to a flip in the \(x_2\) coordinate:

\beq
f(V_1,V_2,V_3; x_1,x_2,x_3,t)=f(V_1,-V_2,V_3;x_1,-x_2,x_3,t)
\eeq

From this, we can conclude that \(\la V_1V_2\ra\) is an odd function of \(x_2\), while \(\la V_1V_1\ra\) and \(\la V_2V_2\ra\) are even functions of \(x_2\). However, because the flow is not independent of \(x_2\), we cannot conclude anything about these components being zero throughout the entire domain as we could with respect to the \(x_3\) axis.




\section{Irrotational Motion}
An essential feature of turbulent flows is that they are rotational. If the vorticity is zero, then \(\xi_{ij}=0\) (as well as the product of the mean rate of rotation with velocity). The average is therefore also zero:

\beqa
\label{eq:CorrinKistler}
\la V_i'\left(\frac{\partial V_i'}{\partial x_j}-\frac{\partial V_j'}{\partial x_i}\right)\ra=&0\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left(\frac{1}{2}\la V_i'V_i'\ra\right)-\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\la V_i'V_j'\ra=&0\\
\frac{\partial k}{\partial x_j}-\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\la V_i'V_j'\ra=&0\\
\eeqa

Eq. \eqref{eq:CorrinKistler}, which has assumed incompressibility in the last term, shows that for irrotational flows, the gradient of the Reynolds stress, which is the form that appears in the momentum equation, has the same effect as the isotropic stress, and hence could be absorbed into a modified pressure term. So, for irrotational flows, the Reynolds stresses have no impact on the mean velocity field. Hence, irrotational flow essentially shows no characteristics of turbulence because the Reynolds stress has no impact on the mean velocity.




\section{Free Shear Flows}
% part (iii) on page 94

Free shear flows are flows in which there are no shear stresses that would normally be imposed by solid walls. Jets, wakes behind solid bodies, and mixing layers between two fluids are common examples of free shear flows. 

\subsection{The Round Jet}
Consider a round jet of initial diameter \(d\) with an initially uniform velocity \(U_J\). This flow will be statistically stationary provided the jet velocity does not change with time. By assuming independence of the \(\theta\) coordinate, this flow is then also axisymmetric. Because \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial\theta}=0\), \(\la u'w'\ra=\la v'w'\ra=\la W\ra=0\), where the velocity has components \(U, V, W\). The flow is entirely determined, assuming negligibly small impact of the particular nozzle shape, by \(Re=U_Jd/\nu\). 

The main velocity occurs in the axial direction, and the centerline velocity \(U_0\) decreases going down the jet. However, because the jet spreads, at any particular \(r/r_{1/2}\), the velocity will be maximum at some intermediate \(x/d\). The jet half-width, or \(r_{1/2}\), is the radius at which the mean axial velocity is half of the centerline velocity. The mean radial velocity is about an order of magnitude smaller than the mean axial velocity. All of the remaining analysis assumes we are in the developed region, which begins around \(x/d=30\). As the jet decays and spreads, the mean velocity profile will change, but \(\la U\ra/U_0(x)\) plotted as a function of \(r/r_{1/2}\) collapses onto a single curve, showing that the velocity profile in a round jet is self-similar. Away from the development region, it is experimentally found that the centerline velocity, normalized by the jet velocity, decreases as \(1/x\). 

\beq
\label{eq:Uo}
\frac{U_0(x)}{U_J}=\frac{B}{(x-x_0)/d}
\eeq

It is also experimentally found that the jet spreads linearly, i.e. the jet half-width increases as \(x\), where \(S\) is the spreading rate. This linear spreading makes sense from the point of view of the conical regions that are typically drawn for jets (as opposed to some type of quadratic spreading). 

\beq
r_{1/2}(x)=S(x-x_0)
\eeq

Experimentally, people have found that the slope \(B\) and spreading rate \(S\) are independent of \(Re\), which is surprising given that the only dimensionless quantity that should govern the flow is the Reynolds number. Jets of all Reynolds numbers will decay and spread at roughly the same rate, but the Reynolds number will still certainly have an impact on the file-scale structure of the flow. Because the velocity decays at a rate independent of \(Re\), then because \(\la U\ra/U_0(x)\) is self-similar, the mean velocity profile is independent of \(Re\). For very low Reynolds number flows, this self-similarity breaks down. 

A similarity solution can be developed for the round jet by selecting a similarity variable for the cross-stream coordinate as:

\beq
\xi=\frac{r}{r_{1/2}}
\eeq

which can equivalently be expressed in terms of the axial coordinate \(x\) by multiplying by the formula above for \(r_{1/2}(x)\):

\beq
\xi=\frac{r}{S(x-x_0)}
\eeq

which inspires the definition of an alternative similarity variable (since a multiplication of a similarity variable by a constant will give another equivalent similarity variable):

\beq
\label{eq:eta}
\eta=\frac{r}{x-x_0}
\eeq

From experimental data that tells us that \(\la U\ra/U_0(x)\) gives a profile that is independent of \(r/r_{1/2}\), we define a self-similar velocity profile as:

\beq
\label{eq:ssV}
f(\eta)=\frac{\la U(x,r)\ra}{U_0(x)}
\eeq

Because \(\la U\ra\) is self-similar, by the continuity equation, \(\la V\ra\) must also be self-similar, but by a different similarity function \(h(\eta)\) such that \(\la V\ra/U_0(x)=h(\eta)\). To show this, begin from the continuity equation in polar coordinates:

\beq
\frac{\partial\la U\ra}{\partial x}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r\la V\ra)=0
\eeq

By the chain rule and from the definition of the self-similar velocity profile in Eq. \eqref{eq:ssV}, \(U_0(x)\) from Eq. \eqref{eq:Uo}, and \(\eta\) from Eq. \eqref{eq:eta}:

\beqa
\frac{\partial\la U\ra}{\partial x}=&f(\eta)\frac{\partial U_0(x)}{\partial x}+U_0(x)\frac{\partial f(\eta)}{\partial\eta}\frac{\partial\eta}{\partial x}\\
\frac{\partial\la U\ra}{\partial x}=&f(\eta)\left(\frac{-U_0(x)}{x}\right)+U_0(x)\frac{\partial f(\eta)}{\partial\eta}\left(\frac{-r}{x^2}\right)\\
\frac{\partial\la U\ra}{\partial x}=&\frac{-U_0(x)}{x}\left\lbrack f(\eta)+\frac{\partial f(\eta)}{\partial\eta}\eta\right\rbrack\\
\frac{\partial\la U\ra}{\partial x}=&\frac{-U_0(x)}{x}\frac{\partial (f(\eta)\eta)}{\partial\eta}\\
\eeqa

Substituting this result into the continuity equation, along with the similarity expression for the lateral velocity, gives a condition for the similarity profiles such that \(\la V\ra\) is self-similar. Plotting the similarity profile for the lateral velocity shows that the velocity is zero at \(\xi=0\), which is to be expected from conservation of mass requirements as you approach the centerline. The lateral velocity must decay to zero far from the jet, so the lateral velocity reaches a maximum around \(\xi=0.7\), and becomes negative beyond roughly the half-width of the jet, indicating that fluid at the jet edges becomes entrained in the jet. By defining the self-similarity function \(f(\eta)\), \(h(\eta)\) can be determined, and this will show that the lateral velocity is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than the axial velocity. 

\beqa
\frac{-U_0(x)}{x}\frac{\partial (f(\eta)\eta)}{\partial\eta}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(rh(\eta)U_0(x)\right)=&0\\
-\eta\frac{\partial (f(\eta)\eta)}{\partial\eta}+r\frac{\partial h(\eta)}{\partial \eta}\frac{\partial\eta}{\partial r}+h(\eta)=&0\\
\eta\frac{\partial (f(\eta)\eta)}{\partial\eta}=&\frac{\partial (h(\eta)\eta)}{\partial \eta}\\
\eeqa

Like the centerline velocity, the square root of the \(\la U'U'\ra\) Reynolds stress also decays as \(1/x\). Due to this observation, you might also expect, like the axial and lateral velocities, the Reynolds stresses normalized by the centerline velocity to be self-similar. On the centerline of the jet, the square root of the axial normal Reynolds stress is about 25\% of the mean. The Reynolds stresses exhibit significant anisotropy even in this simple round jet. As expected, the normal Reynolds stress along the axis is the largest component, while the shear components are the smallest. Because the shear components are odd functions of \(r\), the shear component is zero at \(r=0\). By normalizing the shear stresses by the turbulent kinetic energy, we see from experimental data that the shear stresses are roughly one third of the turbulent kinetic energy, though the shear stresses drop to zero at the centerline of the jet. All components of the Reynolds stress decay to zero far from the jet.

The derivative of the axial velocity with respect to \(r\) is always negative because the velocity is largest at the centerline and decays moving to greater \(r\). From the definition of the orientation of shear stress, the shear stress will be positive if \(\partial\la U\ra/\partial r<0\). Hence, for the round jet, the shear stress is always positive, which gives rise to a positive turbulent viscosity. Because the mean velocities and the Reynolds stresses are self-similar, this turbulent viscosity is also self-similar. Because the shear stresses are odd functions of \(r\), as is \(\partial\la U\ra/\partial r\), the turbulent viscosity is an even function of \(r\), and is roughly uniform in the center of the jet, but decreases at the edge of the jet. 





\subsection{Boundary Layer Equations}
For the round jet, because the lateral velocity is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the axial velocity, we can assume that axial gradients are of much smaller magnitude than lateral gradients. The assumption of negligible gradients in certain directions of the flow leads to boundary layer equations, which are simplified versions of the governing equations. 




\section{Self-Similarity}
Self-similarity is a very important concept in the study of fluids because it is often one of the only ways that  analytic solutions can be determined for certain classes of flows. Consider an arbitrary quantity \(Q\) that depends on two variables, \(x\) and \(y\). We can attempt to scale the quantity and \textit{one} of its dependent variables by parameters that only depend on the \textit{other} dependent variable:

\beq
\xi=\frac{y}{\delta(x)}
\eeq

\beq
\hat{Q}(\xi,x)=\frac{Q(x,y)}{Q_0(x)}
\eeq

If \(\hat{Q}(\xi,x)\) is independent of \(x\), then \(Q(x,y)\) is self-similar, and its variation with respect to two variables \(x\) and \(y\) can be reduced to variation with respect to a single variable \(\xi\) that is some function of \(x\) and \(y\). In this case, the PDE for \(Q\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\) is reduced to an ODE in terms of \(Q_0(x), \delta(x), \hat{Q}(\xi)\). Based on the starting equations for applying self-similarity arguments, self-similar behavior may only be observed over some range in \(x\) and \(y\). 



\section{The Modeling of Turbulence}

It is very difficult to develop tractable models for turbulent flows for several reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\item The flows are time-dependent, three-dimensional, and random
\item The largest turbulent motions are on the order of the characteristic flow scale of the geometry, and hence boundary condition effects cannot be neglected
\item There is a large range in timescales and lengthscales - the Kolmogorov timescale decreases as \(Re^{-1/2}\), while the Kolmogorov lengthscale decreases as \(Re^{-3/4}\). In wall-bounded flows, the most energetic motions, which are responsible for peak turbulence production, scale with the viscous lengthscale, which is very small and decreases as \(Re^{-0.8}\). 
\item The nonlinear convection term and the pressure gradient term cause great numerical difficulties - when the pressure gradient term is expressed in terms of the Pressure Poisson equation, it is both nonlinear and non-local. 
\end{itemize}

Most turbulence models consists of sets of partial differential equations, and in some cases also algebraic equations. While turbulence \textit{simulations} solve for time-dependent fields that represent one realization of a turbulent flow, turbulence \textit{models} solve for the mean quantities. DNS and LES are two examples of turbulence simulations. In DNS, you solve for the actual velocity field, and because you need to have a mesh that can resolve all of the timescales and lengthscales, DNS is very computationally expensive. Computational cost scales as \(Re^3\) for 3-D simulations, and hence DNS is restricted to low Reynolds number flows, and hence is of less practical importance than other simulations or models. In LES, you solve for a filtered velocity field that is representative of the larger-scale turbulent motions, with a model for the impact of the smaller-scale motions on the larger-scale motions included in the system of equations (though the smaller scales are not directly modeled). 

The RANS equations solves the Reynolds equations to determine the mean fields. The Reynolds stresses are either solved for using models such as turbulent viscosity, where that turbulent viscosity is determined from an algebraic relationship as in the mixing-length model or from turbulence quantities such as \(k\) and \(\epsilon\) with their own transport equations. In Reynolds-stress models, transport equations are solved for the Reynolds stresses, eliminating the needed for the turbulent viscosity models. Finally, because the mean velocity and the Reynolds stresses are the first and second moments of the Eulerian PDF of velocity, PDF methods solve a model transport equation for a PDF such as \(f\). 




\subsection{Gradient-Diffusion Methods}
This model assumes that the turbulent transport of the passive scalar \(\phi\), \(\la \vv{V}'\phi'\ra\), occurs down the mean scalar gradient, in the direction of \(-\nabla\la\phi\ra\) proportional to the turbulent diffusivity \(\Gamma_T\). This is equivalent to Fourier's law of heat conduction or Fick's law.

\beq
\la\vv{V}'\phi'\ra=-\Gamma_T\nabla\la\phi\ra
\eeq

Because this form will lead to two diffusion terms in mean equation, the two terms can be condensed into one by defining an effective diffusivity \(\Gamma_{eff}=\Gamma+\Gamma_T\). Hence, this simply model assumes that the turbulent transport of \(\phi\) occurs as if \(\phi\) were being diffused with higher diffusivity. In the Reynolds momentum equation, the gradient-diffusion approximation for incompressible flow, assuming constant \(\Gamma_T\) leads to:

\beq
\frac{\partial \la V_i\ra}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left(\la V_i\ra\la V_j\ra+\la V_i'V_j'\ra\right)+\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial \la P\ra}{\partial x_i}-\nu_{eff}\frac{\partial^2 \la V_i\ra}{\partial x_j\partial x_j}=0
\eeq

This model assumes that \(\la \vv{V}'\phi'\ra\) is aligned with \(\la\nabla\la\phi\ra\), which is not the case even in simple turbulent flows. 






\subsection{Turbulent Viscosity Methods}
Turbulent viscosity methods are similar to gradient-diffusion methods in that both result in \(\nu\) simply being increased by a constant, except that gradient-diffusion method assume that constant represents proportionality to the mean gradient via Fourier's law, while turbulent viscosity methods assume that constant represents equivalence between the deviatoric Reynolds stress and the mean rate of strain. The turbulent viscosity method is based on the relationship for the deviatoric stress tensor in the Navier-Stokes equation, which from the constitutive relationship for \(\sigma_{ij}\), is assumed proportional to \(e_{ij}\):

\beq
\sigma_{ij}=-P\delta_{ij}+c_{ijkl}e_{ij}
\eeq

The deviatoric portion of the Reynolds stress \(a_{ij}\) is assumed proportional to the mean rate of strain \(\la e_{ij}\ra\):

\beq
a_{ij}=2\nu_T\left(\frac{\partial \la V_i\ra}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial \la V_j\ra}{\partial x_i}\right)
\eeq

where \(\nu_T\) is the turbulent viscosity. Then, inserting this into the Reynolds momentum equation:

\beq
\rho\frac{\partial \la V_i\ra}{\partial t}+\rho\frac{\partial(\la V_i\ra\la V_j\ra)}{\partial x_j}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left\lbrack(\mu+\mu_T)\left(\frac{\partial\la V_i\ra}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial\la V_j\ra}{\partial x_i}\right)-\left(\la P\ra+\frac{2}{3}k\right)\delta_{ij}\right\rbrack
\eeq

This model assumes that \(a_{ij}\) is aligned with \(\la e_{ij}\ra\), which is not the case even in simple turbulent flows. At high \(Re\), both \(\nu_T\) and \(\Gamma_T\) scale with the flow velocity and length scale, independent of the actual molecular properties of the flow:

\beq
\frac{\nu_T}{\nu}\approx\frac{VD}{\nu}
\eeq

and hence both \(\nu_T/\nu\) and \(\Gamma_T/\Gamma\) increase linearly with Reynolds number, so molecular transport becomes increasingly negligible as the Reynolds number increases. The turbulent Prandtl number \(Pr_T\) is defined as:

\beq
Pr_T=\frac{\nu_T}{\Gamma_T}
\eeq

and is often near unity for simply turbulent flows.
