\section{The Discrete Ordinates Method}
\label{sec:SN}

The discrete ordinates method is an approach for discretization of the angular dependence of \(\psi\) that is equivalent to a collocation method in angle; the angular dependence of \(\psi\) is represented by the angular dependence at a series of discrete directions \(\hO_n\) for \(n=1,\cdots,N\):

\beq
\psi_n(\vv{r},E,t)\equiv\psi(\vv{r},E,\hO_n,t)
\eeq

The \gls{nte} can then be written for each discrete direction \(\hO_n\), with solution variable \(\psi_n\):

\beqa
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\psi_n(\vv{r},E,t)}{v(E)}\right)+\hO_n\cdot\nabla\psi_n(\vv{r},E,t)+\Sigma_{t,n}(\vv{r},E,t)\psi_n(\vv{r},E,t)=\\
\sum_{n'=1}^Nw_{n'}\dEprime \Sigma_s(\vv{r},E'\rightarrow E',\hO_{n'}\rightarrow\hO_n,t)\psi_{n'}(\vv{r},E',t)+\\
\chi_{p,n}(E)\sum_{n'=1}^Nw_{n'}\dEprime\left\lbrack1-\beta(E')\right\rbrack\nu(E')\Sigma_{f,n
'}(\vv{r},E',t)\psi_n(\vv{r},E,t)+\\
\sum_{j=1}^J\chi_{d,j,n}(E)\lambda_jC_j(\vv{r},t)+S_n(\vv{r},E,t)
\eeqa

where the angular integrals have been replaced by quadrature formulas with points selected to match the discrete directions \(\hO_n\). For example, the integral of an arbitrary quantity \(f\) is replaced by the following quadrature rule:

\beq
\dEprime\dhOprime f\seatelse=\sum_{n'=1}^Nw_{n'}\dEprime f_{n'}(\vv{r},E',t)\psi_{n'}(\vv{r},E',t)
\eeq

The \(S_N\) method is named after the early one-dimensional treatments that used the trapezoidal quadrature set, which is equivalent to treating the angular dependence as \(N\) straight line segments. The \(S_N\) method is the primary way in which the transport equation is discretized in angle, since it has a simple derivation, closely resembles the Boltzmann transport equation, and does not have to deal with as many strange math properties as the \(P_N\) method. In 1-D, \(S_N\) is equivalent to Legendre expansions. 

To begin, the scattering and external source are expanded into spherical harmonics. Assuming azimuthal symmetry, the scattering cross section can be expanded as in Eq. \eqref{eq:ScatteringLegendre2}. Beginning with the fixed-source problem in Eq. \eqref{eq:TE_fixedsource}, repeated here for reference:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
 \hO  \cdot\nabla\psi(\vv{r}, E, \hO  ) + 
 \Sigma_t(\vv{r},E)\psi(\vv{r}, E, \hO  ) = \\
S(\vv{r}, E, \hO  ) + \int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \int_{4\pi}^{ } d\hO  ' \Sigma_s(\vv{r}, E'\rightarrow E, \hO  '\rightarrow\hO  )\psi(\vv{r}, E', \hO  ')\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

The scattering source is expanded in Legendre polynomials according to Eq. \eqref{eq:ScatteringLegendre2}.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
 \hO  \cdot\nabla\psi(\vv{r}, E, \hO  ) + 
 \Sigma_t(\vv{r},E)\psi(\vv{r}, E, \hO  ) = \\
S(\vv{r}, E, \hO  ) + \int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \int_{4\pi}^{ } d\hO  ' \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\frac{2l+1}{4\pi}\Sigma_{s,l}(\vv{r}, E'\rightarrow E)P_l(\hO  \cdot\hO  ')\psi(\vv{r}, E', \hO  ')\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Because the scattering operator is real (i.e. not complex), \(P_l(\hO  \cdot\hO  ')\) can be expanded in real and complex components, and then the complex components set to zero. The end result of this expansion, where only real components result, is given in Eq. \eqref{eq:FullExpansion5}. Using this expansion, the scattering term becomes:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ScatteringSourceSN}
\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \int_{4\pi}^{ } d\hO  ' \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\Sigma_{s,l}(\vv{r}, E'\rightarrow E)\left\lbrack Y_{l0}^e(\hO  )Y_{l0}^e(\hO  ')+\sum_{m=1}^{l}\left(Y_{lm}^e(\hO  )Y_{lm}^{e}(\hO  ')+Y_{lm}^o(\hO  )Y_{lm}^{o}(\hO  ')\right)\right\rbrack\psi(\vv{r}, E', \hO  ')\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
For simplicity, Eq. \eqref{eq:ScatteringSourceSN} is sometimes written in compact notation by defining:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:FluxMoments31}
\begin{aligned}
e_{lm}(\vv{r},E')=\int_{4\pi}^{}d\hO  'Y_{lm}^e(\hO  ')\psi(\vv{r}, E',\hO  ')\\
o_{lm}(\vv{r},E')=\int_{4\pi}^{}d\hO  'Y_{lm}^o(\hO  ')\psi(\vv{r}, E',\hO  ')\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Inserting these definitions removes, in compact notation, the angular dependency on \(\hO  '\):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ScatteringSourceSNSimple}
\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\Sigma_{s,l}(\vv{r}, E'\rightarrow E)\left\lbrack Y_{l0}^e(\hO  )e_{l0}(\vv{r},E')+\sum_{m=1}^{l}\left(Y_{lm}^e(\hO  )e_{lm}(\vv{r},E')+Y_{lm}^o(\hO  )o_{lm}(\vv{r},E')\right)\right\rbrack\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{tcolorbox}

The order of the scattering expansion in Eq. \eqref{eq:ScatteringSourceSN} is infinite because \(0\leq l\leq\infty\). However, this expansion must be truncated, and hence \(N\) in \(0\leq l\leq N\) represents the order of the scattering expansion. This order is referenced sometimes as the ``\(P_N\) scattering expansion.'' 

Likewise, the external source can also be expanded into real and imaginary components, and the imaginary components set to zero. The only differences are that there is no cross section moment present (since an external source does not depend on any cross section of the medium) and the source is not proportional to the angular flux. Hence, the external source is:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:14}
S(\vv{r},E, \hO  )=\int_{4\pi}^{}d\hO  '\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}S(\vv{r},E', \hO  ')\left\lbrack Y_{l0}^e(\hO  )Y_{l0}^e(\hO  ')+\sum_{m=1}^{l}\left(Y_{lm}^e(\hO  )Y_{lm}^{e}(\hO  ')+Y_{lm}^o(\hO  )Y_{lm}^{o}(\hO  ')\right)\right\rbrack 
\end{equation}

\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
For simplicity, Eq. \eqref{eq:14} is sometimes written in compact notation by defining:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
s_{lm}(\vv{r},E')=\int_{4\pi}^{}d\hO  'Y_{lm}^e(\hO  ')S(\vv{r}, E',\hO  ')\\
v_{lm}(\vv{r},E')=\int_{4\pi}^{}d\hO  'Y_{lm}^o(\hO  ')S(\vv{r}, E',\hO  ')\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Inserting these definitions removes, in compact notation, the angular dependency on \(\hO  '\):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ExternalSourceSNSimple}
\begin{aligned}
S(\vv{r},E, \hO  )=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left\lbrack Y_{l0}^e(\hO  )s_{l0}(\vv{r},E)+\sum_{m=1}^{l}\left(Y_{lm}^e(\hO  )s_{lm}(\vv{e},E)+Y_{lm}^o(\hO  )v_{lm}(\vv{r},E)\right)\right\rbrack
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{tcolorbox}

The external source expansion in Eq. \eqref{eq:ExternalSourceSNSimple}, and the scattering source expansion in Eq. \eqref{eq:ScatteringSourceSNSimple}, are then combined in the neutron transport equation to give the \(S_N\) equations:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SnGeneral}
\begin{aligned}
 \hO  \cdot\nabla\psi(\vv{r}, E, \hO  ) + 
 \Sigma_t(\vv{r},E)\psi(\vv{r}, E, \hO  ) = \\
\sum_{l=0}^{N}\left\lbrack Y_{l0}^e(\hO  )s_{l0}(\vv{r},E)+\sum_{m=1}^{l}\left(Y_{lm}^e(\hO  )s_{lm}(\vv{e},E)+Y_{lm}^o(\hO  )v_{lm}(\vv{r},E)\right)\right\rbrack+\\
\int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \sum_{l=0}^{N}\Sigma_{s,l}(\vv{r}, E'\rightarrow E)\left\lbrack Y_{l0}^e(\hO  )e_{l0}(\vv{r},E')+\sum_{m=1}^{l}\left(Y_{lm}^e(\hO  )e_{lm}(\vv{r},E')+Y_{lm}^o(\hO  )o_{lm}(\vv{r},E')\right)\right\rbrack\quad\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where the infinite sums in \(l\) have been truncated to \(N\) terms. For \(N\), \((N+1)^2\) moments must be computed. The \(S_N\) method is a collocation method in angle, which means that the solution is sought for fixed, discrete values in angle. Integrals over angle are replaced by quadrature rules

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:multigroupTE2}
\int_{4\pi}^{} f(\hO  )d\hO   = \sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n f(\hO  _n)
\end{equation}

where \(N\) is the order, or the amount of directions modeled. These weights are normalized such that an integral over the unit sphere still provides the correct numerical result:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:QuadratureNormalization}
\int_{4\pi}^{}d\hO  =\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n =4\pi
\end{equation}

We replace each occurrence of \(\hO  \) in Eq. \eqref{eq:SnGeneral} by \(\hO  _a\) to indicate a particular direction. Then, Eq. \eqref{eq:SnGeneral} applies for each direction. All other terms in the equation are then integrated using quadrature rules. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SnGeneral}
\begin{aligned}
 \hO  _a\cdot\nabla\psi_a(\vv{r}, E) + 
 \Sigma_t(\vv{r},E)\psi_a(\vv{r}, E) = \\
\sum_{l=0}^{N}\left\lbrack Y_{l0}^e(\hO  _a)s_{l0}(\vv{r},E)+\sum_{m=1}^{l}\left(Y_{lm}^e(\hO  _a)s_{lm}(\vv{e},E)+Y_{lm}^o(\hO  _a)v_{lm}(\vv{r},E)\right)\right\rbrack+\\
\int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \sum_{l=0}^{N}\Sigma_{s,l}(\vv{r}, E'\rightarrow E)\left\lbrack Y_{l0}^e(\hO  _a)e_{l0}(\vv{r},E')+\sum_{m=1}^{l}\left(Y_{lm}^e(\hO  _a)e_{lm}(\vv{r},E')+Y_{lm}^o(\hO  _a)o_{lm}(\vv{r},E')\right)\right\rbrack\quad\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where notation has been simplified by indicating that \(\psi_a(\vv{r},E)\equiv\psi(\vv{r},E,\hO  _a\). In addition, all the moments are computed using the quadrature rule:

\begin{equation}
e_{lm}=\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_nY_{lm}^e(\hO  _n)\psi_a(\vv{r},E)
\end{equation}

and so forth for the remaining moments. Note that the quadrature rule used is a quadrature rule in angle. It is customary to select the quadrature points in this quadrature rule, i.e. the \(\hO  _n\) in the above equation, to match the discrete choices of \(\hO  _a\) that appear in the \(S_N\) equations. 

The order of the \(S_N\) method and the order of the \(P_L\) expansion discussed in reference to Eq. \ref{eq:ScatteringMomentsLegendre} result in different numbers of discrete directions and angular moments depending on the dimensionality of the problem. In 1-D, there are \(N\) discrete directions and \(L\) angular moments. In 2-D however, there are \(N(N+2)/2\) directions and \((L+1)(L+2)/2\) angular moments, and in 3-D, there are \(N(N+2)\) directions and \((L+1)^2\) moments. 

The \(S_N\) method will converge to the true solution provided the quadrature rule accurately integrates the spherical harmonics. An important phenomena that sometimes arises with the \(S_N\) method is ray effects. Because we constrain the flux to travel only along discrete directions, nothing can be said about the accuracy not along those angles. Non-physical ``crown-like'' patterns can result, but this can be fixed by computing a first-collided source as the actual source to be used in the computation, providing a diffuse starting source without significantly reducing accuracy. 

\subsubsection{Quadrature}

\subsubsubsection{Level-Symmetric Quadrature}
While there are many options for quadrature sets, the Level-Symmetric quadrature set is the set most often associated with the \(S_N\) method. With this set, there are \(N(N+2)\) angular directions per spatial location (N(N+2)/8 per octant). The Level-Symmetric quadrature set uses the same set of \(N/2\) positive values of direction cosines for each of the components of \(\hO  \). Because this quadrature set is symmetric, no direction gets preferential treatment. Different quadrature sets could be used for different computations where it is expected for streaming to occur preferentially in some directions over others. 

Because of the symmetry constraints, not all of the choices for the quadrature points are independent, and in fact there is only one degree of freedom for each choice of quadrature set. A second constraint given by Eq. \eqref{eq:QuadratureNormalization} then narrows down the options for the quadrature set. With these two constraints, \(S_2\) quadrature is fixed, but for higher orders, there are several options remaining for the quadrature points. 

\subsubsubsection{\(LQ_N\) Quadrature}

With the same symmetry and normalization constraints as the Level-Symmetric quadrature set, the \(LQ_N\) quadrature set imposes the additional requirement that the quadrature set should correctly integrate as many Legendre polynomials as possible. 

\subsubsection{Spatial Discretization}

The \(S_N\) equations provide the framework to discretize the angular flux in angle, but the equations still must be discretized in space. In general, there are two different means to perform spatial discretization - cell balance methods, which preserve conservation of the solution, and finite element methods, which do not necessarily preserve conservation of the solution. In a single mesh cell, cell balance methods will provide a statement that is equivalent to conservation of neutrons, while finite element methods satisfy the governing equation in a weighted-integral sense. For simplicity, all of the spatial discretization schemes discussed here are applied to the simplified transport equation that neglects time dependence and assumes some angular discretization has already been applied to \(\psi\) such that it is independent of angle (in each of these equations):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SimpleTE}
\hO  \cdot\nabla\psi(\vv{r},E)+\Sigma_t{\vv{r},E}\psi(\vv{r},E)=S(\vv{r},E)
\end{equation}

where \(S\) represents the scattering, fission, and external sources. There will be one of these equations for each discrete direction in the \(S_N\) method. For all the following discretization schemes, a Cartesian mesh given in Fig. \ref{fig:CartesianDiscretization} is assumed, with \(i\) representing indices in the \(x\)-direction, \(j\) in the \(y\)-direction, and \(k\) in the \(z\)-direction.
